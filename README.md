# N-N-cinema
a Host and Guests sharing each others streams with each other

a Host has some info to share (via a media stream)

Guests get tickets to consume the stream

Guests also have info to share (their own media stream)

each Host and Guest is a node in a network (N-N)
each node has a wishlist (list of streams this node wants to consume)
each node has i/o bandwidth

the Host node is used as a server for communication

use the best current algorithm to optimise the path of info to satisfy every nodes wishlist whilst minizing latency
nodes are compensated with coins considering their bandwidth

use cases: cinemas that also show the audience, speeches, readings, meetings, 1-on-1 chats
